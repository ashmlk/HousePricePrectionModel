# HousePricePrectionModel
This model is focus on building a model for predicting  house prices based on numerous feature.
House prices change not on by their size or number of rooms but we can observe that a lot of other factors can change the house price.
Throughout this model we do the following steps:
  1. Observing data, its features, columns and length.
  2. Annalyzing the test variable(SalePrice), by finding the correlation of data and finding the top 60%
  3. Impute missing data and cleaning them.
  4. Feature tranformation and engineering to fit the model for prediction.
  5. Applying both classification and regression techniques to find the accuracy of each model.
P.S: Stacking the models will be added to the program soon.
Data is from: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data 


Please note that the code has been written by executing each line of code simultaneously and retrieving relevant data.

Please keep in mind that for predicting the prices, we have a seller and a buyer that the data hs to represent house price in favor of each differently. For instance, a seller will want to sell the price as much as possible there finding all features that can increse the price will be important. 
On the other hand, the buyer will want to know have much each feature effects the sale price and that the money they will be paying will be worth it.
